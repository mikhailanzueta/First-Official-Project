# First-Official-Project
My first portfolio worthy project, Safe Travels. This project encompasses HTML, CSS, and Javascript utilizing the Boostrap 5 library.
Safe Travels is a front-end website that allows users to "book" hotels to various locations around the world. It allows users to 
browse various locations, explore a small gallery, and reading "customer" reviews. Users can also explore the login form and try to create a password. 
There are no working links as this is a soley front-end website. No back-end development is involved in the making of this project.
